# 💼 Career Interests

I am currently interested in the following work directions:

🤖 **Large Language Model Applications**: Developing and deploying practical, production ready applications of LLMs across diverse domains, with an emphasis on real world constraints such as latency, cost, reliability, and user experience.

⚖️ **Large Language Model Alignment**: Aligning LLM behaviors with human values and intentions to build safer, more reliable systems, covering robustness, controllability, and evaluation of alignment outcomes.

🧩 **Agentic Systems for Real World Problem Solving**: Building and iterating on LLM powered agents that can plan, use tools, and execute multi step workflows to solve real user problems end to end, with strong attention to verification, safety, and measurable impact.
